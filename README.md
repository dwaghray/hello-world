# hello-world
general introductory project

I am a junior at Indiana University Bloomington majoring in Informatics with a cognate in Psychology and a minor in Human-Centered Computing. I have had experience with HTML, Python, CSS, and Javascript, and I am familiar with Human-Computer Interaction and Design (HCI/D). Outside of classes, I am also the Internal Co-President of GlobeMed at Indiana University, which is a national organization that focuses on global inequities in healthcare, wealth, and resources. This organization works with communities through partnerships between chapters and grassroots organizations to combat the root of societal problems that cause these inequities. Through my involvement and education at IU, I have developed leadership, communication, and management skills that can be applied to career fields and professional settings in combination with my technical and educational background.
